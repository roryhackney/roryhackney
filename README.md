Hi, I'm Rory Hackney.
I'm a web developer, programmer, and artist from Seattle, WA.
I'm currently in the Web Development Certificate program at Seattle Central, and I have a BFA in Comic Art from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.
I've been learning code on my own for a few years now, but now I'm working on making it my profession.

The languages I've learned so far are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python / Django, and PHP.
I've also been learning about software development, web development / design, and game development / design.
I'm passionate about accessibility, design, and storytelling.

If you want to see more of my art work, check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/roryhackney/) or my [Portfolio](http://www.rorystories.com/).

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!

-Rory
