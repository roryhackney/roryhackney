Hi, I'm Rory Hackney.
I'm a web developer, programmer, and artist from Seattle, WA.
I have a certificate in Web Development, as well as other tech coursework, plus a BFA in Comic Art and a passion for design.
I've been learning code on my own for a few years now, but now I'm working on making it my profession.

I'm strongest in PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Bulma, and have also learned some Django, React, and Wordpress. I just completed my portfolio, which you can see at [https://www.roryhackney.com](https://www.roryhackney.com), and I'm currently studying to improve my React skills.

I'm currently looking for an entry level position in web or application development.
If you'd like to contact me, my email is roryhackney@gmail.com, and my phone is 206 488 5437.

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!

-Rory
