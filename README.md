Hi, I'm Rory Hackney.
I'm a software developer, web developer, and artist from Seattle, WA.

I'm currently studying Computer Science and have a certificate in Web Development, as well as a BFA. After taking some programming classes, I got excited about software development, and am working to build a career in the field while I complete my Bachelors in Computer Science. I hope to work on software that connects to my arts background, but enjoy building all kinds of tech projects. Right now I'm working on an art supply collection tracker with types defined by users. I also enjoy mixing code and art to study interactive storytelling and game development.

I'm strongest in Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Figma, and PHP. You can see my portfolio at [https://www.roryhackney.com](https://www.roryhackney.com). Having studied CS theory, data structures and algorithms, I'm now working on building larger projects and work for clients, while working as a CS tutor for Seattle Colleges.

I'm currently a Senior, currently looking for part time work or internships that can accommodate my evening classes, or full time work starting in April 2025.

If you'd like to contact me, my email is roryhackney@gmail.com, and my phone is 206 488 5437.

Thanks for your time, and have a great day!

-Rory
