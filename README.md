Hi, I'm Rory Hackney.
I'm a software developer, web developer, and artist from Seattle, WA.

I'm currently studying Computer Science and have a certificate in Web Development, as well as a BFA in Comic Art. After taking some programming classes, I got excited about software development, and am working to build a career in the field while I complete my Bachelors in Computer Science. I hope to work on software that connects to my arts background, but enjoy building all kinds of tech projects. Right now I'm working on an art supply collection tracker with types defined by users. I also enjoy mixing code and art to study interactive storytelling and game development.

I'm strongest in Java, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Bulma. I recently launched my portfolio, which you can see at [https://www.roryhackney.com](https://www.roryhackney.com), and I'm currently studying to improve my understanding of CS theory.

I'm currently a Junior, looking for an internship in computer science for Summer 2024, and am open to part time work that can accommodate my evening courses during the school year.
If you'd like to contact me, my email is roryhackney@gmail.com, and my phone is 206 488 5437.

Thanks for your time, and have a great day!

-Rory
